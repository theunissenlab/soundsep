    This can be done in two modes: "broadband" or "max_zscore"

    Broadband mode is the normal amplitude envelope calcualtion. In broadband
    mode, the signal is bandpass filtered, rectified, and then lowpass filtered.

    Max Zscore mode is useful to detect calls which may be more localized in
    the frequency domain from background (white) noise. In max_zscore mode, a
    spectrogram is computed with spec_sample_rate time bins and
    spec_freq_spacing frequency bins. For each time bin, the power in each
    frequency bin is zscored and the max zscored value is assigned to the
    envelope for that bin.
